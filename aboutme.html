    <p style="font-size:120%;"> My name is Danielle Crevecoeur and I am from Stamford, Connecticut. I am 16 years old and I go to Westhill High School. I have an older bother, an older sister, a twin sister, and a younger sister. I was born on January 8, 2001.
    
     My likes include volleyball, shopping, cooking, fashion, math and art. 
     My dislikes include washing dishes and being stressed out. 
     One Fun Fact about me is that my middle name is Sidney.</p>

  <p style="font-size:120%;"> Some differences between Python and Scratch is that Scratch is way more simple and straightforward, but when using Python there is much more room for error and mistakes. What is similar about both of these programs is that you as the user can add inputs and commands to then be performed.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> How I felt about having to constantly debug my system was equal parts frustration and equal parts determination but once I finally got it to work it was very satisfying.</p>

   <p style="font-size:120%;">Today I learned about circuits and LED lights. One obstacle was confused about what the button does and how it works. </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Robotics: After talking about robots and their ethics today my understanding of them changed because i now know how complicated they are and how much work are actually put into them. What makes me excited about the future robotics is that they can be used to help improve our world and our lives for the better. What makes me nervous about the future for robotics is how they will soon replace most things - like driving for example - and it is going to limit the amount of daily tasks we are doing. What also makes me nervous about the future of robotics is the possibility of malfunctions and them having issues and bugs like the technoglogy in our age has, like cell phones and laptops for example. What worked well in working in groups today was having different point of views and different perspectives when trying to work out an issue. Also, if someone was confused about something there is likely someone else in that group that can clarify it for them and explain it to them. What I personally can do better next time is speaking up and contributing into the discussions more than I did today. Also if I was confused about something I would ask next time or research it.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Today I learned the difference between input and output and the fact that we can make the robots move based off of where they were and if they were touching a wall or not. And also if it was touching a wall, then we could make it move to wherever we chose, which I thought was pretty cool especially since we worked so well together.
